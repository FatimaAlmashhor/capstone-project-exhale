    text:
      'Bipolar disorder is a complicated mental illness. It has a variety of layers and symptoms, which can make it difficult to understand. However, this doesn’t mean that it — or the people who have it — should have to deal with unfair assumptions and misconceptions. ',

    title: 'Does Victim Mentality Play a Role in Depression?',
    text:
      'First off, I want to clarify that depression and victim mentality are not the same. The former is a mental illness that no one can choose, while the latter is a mindset that may or may not be a choice. That said, victim mentality does play a role in depression, which is why it is crucial to identify and manage it.',

    title: 'When the Pressure to Succeed Damages Your Mental Health',
    text:
      'Nobody is immune to the pressure to succeed. Whether it comes from family, teachers, bosses, or ourselves, the pressure to "achieve" is something we have all felt. Its not necessarily a bad thing: pressure (or your perception of it) can give you a competitive drive, the impetus to keep going when you feel like giving up, and it can result in great things, both professionally and personally. However, when that pressure to succeed becomes so intense that you lose sight of everything else, its time to pump the brakes and reevaluate your priorities. Sure, success is great, but not when it comes at the expense of your mental health.',
